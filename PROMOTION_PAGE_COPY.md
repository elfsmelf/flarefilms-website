## "IS THIS YOU?" SECTION
**Headline:** YOUR WEDDING HAPPENS ONCE... GET IT CAPTURED PROPERLY

**Subheadline:** IS THIS YOU?

**Pain points:**
- You've seen wedding videos that all look the same — slow motion confetti, generic music, nothing that actually feels real.
- You're worried the videographer will miss the moments that actually matter — your dad's voice during his speech, the look on your partner's face.
- You don't want to wait 6 months wondering when your film will arrive.
- You want someone who actually cares about your story, not just ticking boxes.
- You'd rather know exactly what you're paying upfront than deal with hidden costs and awkward sales calls.

**Transition:** That's exactly why I built Flare Films the way I did.

## MEET RICHARD SECTION
**Headline:** Meet Richard

**Copy:**
I'm Richard, and I've filmed over 120 weddings across Brisbane, the Gold Coast, and the Sunshine Coast.

Here's what makes Flare Films different: I shoot and edit every single wedding myself. No subcontractors. No strangers turning up on your day. Just me.

I've seen too many couples wait months for a film that ends up feeling generic. That's not what your wedding deserves.

I focus on the real moments — your dad's voice cracking, the laughter during speeches, the little glances you'll start to forget if no one captures them properly.

And I deliver in 4 weeks. Guaranteed. Because your wedding film should arrive while you still feel like newlyweds.
